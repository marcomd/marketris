The clone game in JavaScript made by someone who played the original game time ago.

## Plot

An kind princess kidnapped an evil overlord... or maybe. No damn, that was the end, sorry for the spoiler.
Unfortunately the plot of this game is not ready yet (I only got to page 242)
but in the meantime I'll give you a summary: save the world hero!

## Mechanics

Use all the logic you have to fit the pieces together to form complete rows and score points.
Each n completed rows you will pass to the next level, the difficulty will increase but as someone said: "From great difficulties comes great scores".

## Controls

- Left and right arrow keys to move the pieces
- Arrow up to rotate the pieces
- Arrow down to experience buckets of adrenaline
